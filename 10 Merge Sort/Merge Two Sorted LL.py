Merge Two Sorted LL ( ** Interview Question)
Description

The merge method takes in another LinkedList as an input and merges it with the current LinkedList.

The elements in both lists are assumed to be in ascending order.

Parameters

other_list (LinkedList): the other LinkedList to merge with the current list



Return Value

This method does not return a value, but it modifies the current LinkedList to contain the merged list.



Example:

l1 = LinkedList(1)
l1.append(3)
l1.append(5)
l1.append(7)
 
l2 = LinkedList(2)
l2.append(4)
l2.append(6)
l2.append(8)
 
l1.merge(l2)
 
# The current list (l1) now contains the merged list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]


Detailed Steps:

Initialize Helper Nodes:

Create a "dummy" node that acts as a starting point, and give it a value of 0.

Create another node called "current" and set it to point to this dummy node. We'll use "current" to keep track of where we are in the new merged list.

Merge Loop:

This loop will go through each node in both the list we're working on (self.head) and the list we're merging into it (other_head).

For each pair of nodes (one from each list), compare their values.

Take the node with the smaller value and attach it to the "current" node.

Move both the "current" node and the list head that had the smaller value to their respective next nodes.

Check for Remaining Nodes:

After the loop, it's possible that one list still has nodes while the other doesn't.

If that's the case, take the remaining nodes from the list that isn't empty and attach them to "current".

Update Head, Tail, and Length:

Once you're done with the merging, the "dummy" node will still be at the start. Update the head of the list to point to the node that comes immediately after this dummy node.

Also, make sure to update the tail node to be the last node in the new, merged list.

Finally, update the length of the list to account for the nodes from both original lists.

Pseudo Code:

Initial Setup

Create a variable called other_head and set it to the head of other_list

Create a dummy node with a value of 0

Create a variable called current and set it to the dummy node

Merge Loop

While both self.head and other_head are not None

Compare the value of self.head with the value of other_head

If the value of self.head is less than the value of other_head

Set the next of current to self.head

Move self.head to its next node

Else

Set the next of current to other_head

Move other_head to its next node

Move current to its next node

Append Remaining Nodes

If self.head is not None

Set the next of current to self.head

Else

Set the next of current to other_head

Update self.tail to be the tail of other_list

Finalize the Merge

Set self.head to the node that comes after the dummy node

Update the length of self to include the length of other_list

This code defines a method called merge that can be used on a LinkedList object to merge it with another LinkedList object (other_list). The method follows the merge sort algorithm to combine the two lists.

Here's how it works:

The method starts by getting the head node of the other_list and creating a dummy node to hold the merged list.

A current node is created to keep track of the position in the merged list.

A while loop is used to compare the values of the first nodes in both lists. The smaller value is added to the current node, and the respective head node is moved to the next position.

Steps 3 is repeated until one of the lists is empty.

If the first list still has nodes left, they are added to the current node.

If the second list still has nodes left, they are added to the current node.

The head of the merged list is set to the next node after the dummy node, and the length of the list is updated.



Note that this method assumes that both LinkedList objects are already sorted in ascending order. If not, the merge method could produce an incorrectly sorted merged list.
