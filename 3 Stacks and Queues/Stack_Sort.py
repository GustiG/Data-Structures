'''
The sort_stack function takes a single argument, a Stack object.  
The function should sort the elements in the stack in ascending 
order (the lowest value will be at the top of the stack) using 
only one additional stack. 

The function should use the pop, push, peek, and is_empty methods 
of the Stack object.


The function should perform the following tasks:

Create a new instance of the Stack class called sorted_stack.

While the input stack is not empty, perform the following:

Pop the top element from the input stack and store it in a variable
temp.

While the sorted_stack is not empty and its top element is greater 
than temp, pop the top element from sorted_stack and push it back 
onto the input stack.

Push the temp variable onto the sorted_stack.

Once the input stack is empty, transfer the elements back from 
sorted_stack to the input stack. To do this, while sorted_stack 
is not empty, pop the top element from sorted_stack and push it 
onto the input stack.

Pseudo Code:

1. Create a new temporary stack for sorting, called 'sorted_stack'.



2. While the input stack is not empty:

   

   a. Pop the top element from the input stack, store it in 'temp'.

   

   b. While the 'sorted_stack' is not empty and its top element is 
        greater than 'temp':

       

       i. Pop the top element from 'sorted_stack' and push it 
            back onto the input stack.

   

   c. Push 'temp' onto the 'sorted_stack'.



3. Transfer elements back from 'sorted_stack' to the input stack:

   

   a. While 'sorted_stack' is not empty:

       

       i. Pop the top element from 'sorted_stack' and push it 
            onto the input stack.


def sort_stack(stack):
    additional_stack = Stack()
 
    while not stack.is_empty():
        temp = stack.pop()
 
        while not additional_stack.is_empty() \
                                and additional_stack.peek() > temp:
            stack.push(additional_stack.pop())
 
        additional_stack.push(temp)
 
    while not additional_stack.is_empty():
        stack.push(additional_stack.pop())


The sort_stack function sorts a given stack of integers in 
ascending order using only one additional stack. 
Here's how it works:

First, the function creates a new stack called additional_stack 
to hold the sorted elements.

Next, the function enters a while loop that continues until 
the original stack is empty. Inside the loop, the function 
removes the top element from the original stack using the pop 
method and stores it in a temporary variable called temp.

The function then enters another while loop that continues until 
the additional_stack is empty or the top element of 
additional_stack is less than or equal to temp. Inside the loop, 
the function removes the top element from the additional_stack 
using the pop method and adds it back to the original stack using 
the push method.

Once the inner while loop is exited, the function adds the temp 
variable to the additional_stack using the push method. 
This ensures that the additional_stack is always sorted in 
ascending order.

Once the outer while loop is exited, the function enters 
another while loop that continues until the additional_stack 
is empty. Inside the loop, the function removes the top element 
from the additional_stack using the pop method and adds it back 
to the original stack using the push method. This step ensures 
that the original stack is sorted in ascending order.

Finally, the function returns the sorted stack.

Overall, this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), 
where n is the number of elements in the original stack, 
because the function performs nested loops to compare all the 
elements with each other. However, it has the advantage of using 
only one additional stack, which could be useful in certain 
situations where memory is limited.
